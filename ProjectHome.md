This is a program that will find rarfiles (.rar and .part00X etc) files. Determine what kind of media it is, movie / series ,create a folder for that media and unpack it in that directory.

It works by launching the 'unrar' inside a screen, followed by that rm -r command.

This project is in it's very early development and all comments are welcome.

This software is written in python and is dependent that the following programs are installed and working:
python
unrar
screen

I presume that it only works on linux.

!WARNING!
This software is extremly dangerous since it is set to remove the directory where the .rar files were found with the 'rm -r' command.
NO GUARANTEES ARE GIVEN!
At all.
None.
